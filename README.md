Code or Scam? — AI-Generated Code Detector

🔍 Spot risky AI-generated or fake developer code — all in your browser. Fun, bite-sized, and built for devs, learners, and skeptics.

▶️ Try it Live

🎯 What This Tool Solves
AI coding assistants often produce code that looks correct but hides hidden risks:

❌ Hallucinated APIs — e.g., quantum_mine(), web3.metaverse.token

❌ Overly simplistic demos with no error handling (input() without validation)

❌ “Too clean” snippets that work in isolation but fail in real projects

Code or Scam? helps you audit code before trusting it — fully in-browser, zero setup, and privacy-first.

✨ Key Features
9-Language Support: Python, JavaScript, Java, C, C++, Rust, Go, C#, Solidity

AI Risk Detection: Flags hallucinated APIs and demo-only patterns

Syntax Validation: Catches common mistakes like missing f in f-strings

100% Client-Side: Your code never leaves your device Mobile-Built: Entirely developed on a Redmi 15C

Browser-Friendly: No installs, no dependencies, zero friction

⚠️ Note: This tool flags suspicious patterns — it doesn’t catch all AI code. Simple snippets like print("Hello") are valid for humans and AI alike.

💻 How It Works (Simplified)

Paste your code in the browser editor.
The tool scans for suspicious APIs, demo patterns, and common errors.
It highlights potential risks so you know what might break in real-world use.

Behind the scenes: A lightweight, vanilla JS engine checks patterns for risky behavior while staying entirely client-side.
