 Code or Scam? — AI-Generated Code Detector

> 🔍 A lightweight, browser-based tool that helps developers spot risky AI-generated code — especially hallucinated APIs, fake libraries, and oversimplified demos that fail in real-world use.

 🎯 What It Solves
AI coding assistants often produce code that looks correct but hides critical flaws:

- ❌ Fake APIs like `quantum_mine()` or `web3.metaverse.token`
  
- ❌ Overly simplistic demos with no error handling (e.g., `input()` without validation)  

- ❌ "Too clean" snippets that work in isolation but break in production  

This tool helps you **audit code before trusting it — all in your browser, with zero setup.

 ✨ Key Features

- 9-Language Support: Python, JavaScript, Java, C, C++, Rust, Go, C#, Solidity
  
- AI Risk Detection: Flags hallucinated APIs and demo-only patterns
  
- Syntax Validation: Catches common mistakes (e.g., missing `f` in f-strings)
  
- 100% Client-Side: No data leaves your device — privacy-first
 
- Mobile-Built: Developed entirely on Android (Redmi 15C)  

> ⚠️ Note: This tool does not flag all AI code — only suspicious or risky patterns. Trivial examples like `print("Hello")` are valid in both human and AI contexts.
